Power supply test for Cockcroft Walton converter
Hardware tested and working as expected with a Digital Multi-Meter, need to check it with a scope. It is designed to work with the Ketek [PM3325 SiPM](https://www.ketek.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/KETEK-PM3325-WB-D0-Datasheet.pdf) module. In the meantime check out the LTSpice model!
